# Dev-Space

Dev-Space is a real-time collaborative code editor designed to enable multiple users to work together on the same codebase in real time. This project aims to offer a powerful, cloud-based platform for developers to collaborate seamlessly on coding projects, with features like real-time code synchronization, version control, and role-based access management.

## Project Goals

In its current state, Dev-Space is in active development, with a focus on laying the foundational features for a complete collaborative coding environment. The project will eventually include:

- **Real-Time Collaboration:** Users can edit code simultaneously and see changes in real-time.
- **Authentication and Authorization:** Users will log in via OAuth, and role-based permissions will control access to projects.
- **File and Project Management:** Users can create, edit, and delete files, with all changes tracked for future reference.
- **Version Control:** A built-in version control system will allow users to manage file versions and revert to previous states.
- **Code Execution Environment:** A secure environment will be available to run code directly within the platform.
- **Commenting and Feedback:** Users will be able to leave comments and feedback on specific lines of code.

## Current Status

At present, the primary focus is on implementing user **authentication**, which is currently in development. The authentication system will include support for OAuth-based third-party login (GitHub, Google), as well as session management.

Stay tuned for more updates as additional features are added.

## Future Vision

As the project grows, Dev-Space aims to become a fully-featured cloud IDE, providing:

- A complete set of collaborative tools for teams to code together.
- Real-time code diff and merge support for multiple users editing the same file.
- Integrated Git support for managing projects and syncing with external repositories.
- Code execution and debugging tools for a wide variety of programming languages.

Dev-Space will eventually be deployed as a scalable, cloud-based platform, enabling smooth and efficient real-time collaboration for developers around the globe.
